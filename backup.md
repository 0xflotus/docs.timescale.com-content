## Backup & Restore <a id="backup"></a>

In this section, we cover how to backup and restore an entire
database or individual hypertables using the native PostgreSQL
`pg_dump` ([PostgreSQL docs][pg_dump]) and `pg_restore`
([PostgreSQL docs][pg_restore]) commands.

>ttt Upgrades between different versions of TimescaleDB can be done in place;
 you don't need to backup/restore your data.
 Follow these [updating instructions][].

>vvv You must use `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` versions 9.6.2 and above.

### Entire database

To backup a database named _tutorial_, run from the command line:

```bash
pg_dump -f tutorial.bak tutorial
```

Restoring data from a backup currently requires some additional procedures,
which need to be run from `psql`:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE tutorial;
ALTER DATABASE tutorial SET timescaledb.restoring='on';

-- execute the restore (or from a shell)
\! pg_restore -d tutorial tutorial.bak

-- connect to the restored db
\c tutorial
SELECT restore_timescaledb();
ALTER DATABASE tutorial SET timescaledb.restoring='off';
```

### Individual hypertables

Below is the procedure for performing a backup and restore of hypertable `conditions`.

#### Backup

Backup the hypertable schema:
```bash
pg_dump -s -d old_db --table conditions -N _timescaledb_internal | \
  grep -v _timescaledb_internal > schema.sql
```

Backup the hypertable data:
```bash
psql -d old_db \
-c "\COPY (SELECT * FROM conditions) TO data.csv DELIMITER ',' CSV"
```

#### Restore
Restore the schema:
```bash
psql -d new_db < schema.sql
```

Recreate the hypertables:
```bash
psql -d new_db -c "SELECT create_hypertable('conditions', 'time')"
```

>ttt The parameters to `create_hypertable` do not need to be
the same as in the old db, so this is a good way to re-organize
your hypertables (e.g., change partitioning key, number of
partitions, chunk interval sizes, etc.).

Restore the data:
```bash
psql -d new_db -c "\COPY conditions FROM data.csv CSV"
```

>ttt The standard `COPY` command in PostgreSQL is single threaded.
 So to speed up importing larger amounts of data, we recommend using
 our [parallel importer][] instead.
