# Configuring TimescaleDB

TimescaleDB works with the default PostgreSQL server configuration settings.
However, we find that optimizing some settings increases performance. These
settings can be adjusted in your machine's `postgresql.conf`.

>ttt You can determine the location of `postgresql.conf` by running `SHOW config_file;`
from within psql.

## Memory settings [](memory)

The settings `shared_buffers`, `effective_cache_size`, `work_mem`, and
`maintenance_work_mem` need to be adjusted to match the machine's available
memory.  We suggest getting the configuration values from the [PgTune][pgtune]
website (suggeted DB Type: Data warehouse). You should also adjust the
`max_connections` setting to match the ones given by PgTune since there is a
connection between `max_connections` and memory settings. Other settings from
PgTune may also be helpful.

## Disk-write settings [](disk-write)

In order to increase write throughput, there are [multiple
settings][async-commit] to adjust the behaviour that PostgreSQL uses to write data
to disk. We find the performance to be good with the default (safest) settings. If
you want a bit of additional performance, you can  set `synchronous_commit =
'off'`([PostgreSQL docs][synchronous-commit]). Please note that when disabling
`sychronous_commit` in this way, an operating system or database crash might
result in some recent allegedly-committed transactions being lost. We actively
discourage changing the `fsync` setting.

## Lock settings [](locks)

TimescaleDB relies heavily on table partitioning for scaling
time-series workloads, which has implications for [lock
management][lock-management]. A hypertable needs to acquire locks on
many chunks (sub-tables) during queries, which can exhaust the default
limits for the number of allowed locks held. This might result in a
warning like follows:

```sql
psql: FATAL:  out of shared memory
HINT:  You might need to increase max_locks_per_transaction.
```

To avoid this issue, it is necessary to increase the
`max_locks_per_transaction` setting from the default value (which is
typically 64). Since changing this parameter requires a database
restart, it is advisable to estimate a good setting that also allows
some growth. For most use cases we recommend the following setting:

```
max_locks_per_transaction = 2 * num_chunks
```

where `num_chunks` is the upper bound on the number of chunks that
will exist in a hypertable. This setting takes into account that the
number of locks taken by a hypertable query is roughly equal to the
number of chunks in the hypertable, or double that number if the query
also uses an index. Also note that `max_locks_per_transaction` is not
an exact setting; it only controls the *average* number of object
locks allocated for each transaction. For more information, please
review the official PostgreSQL documentation on [lock
management][lock-management].

## Changing configuration with Docker

When running TimescaleDB via a [Docker container][docker], there are
two approaches to modifying your PostgreSQL configuration.  In the
following example, we modify the size of the database instance's
write-ahead-log (WAL) from 1GB to 2GB in a Docker container named
`timescaledb`.

### Modifying postgres.conf inside Docker

1. Get into a shell in Docker in order to change the configuration on a running container.
```
docker start timescaledb
docker exec -i -t timescaledb /bin/bash
```

2. Edit and then save the config file, modifying the setting for the desired configuration parameter (e.g., `max_wal_size`)
```
vi /var/lib/postgresql/data/postgresql.conf
```

3. Restart the container so the config gets reloaded
```
docker restart timescaledb
```

4. Test to see if the change worked.
```
docker exec -it timescaledb psql -U postgres

postgres=# show max_wal_size;
 max_wal_size
--------------
 2GB
```

### Specify config parameters as boot options

Alternatively, one or more parameters can be passed in to the `docker run` command via a `-c` option, as in the following.

```
docker run -i -t timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg10 postgres -cmax_wal_size=2GB
```

Additional examples of passing in arguments at boot can be found in our [discussion about using WAL-E][wale] for incremental backup.
