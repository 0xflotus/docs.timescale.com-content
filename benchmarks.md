# *** Benchmarks

Something something why include benchmarks on the docs page?  Well, many of the questions we get are related to the performance of TimescaleDB as compared to other time-series databases.  We pulled our benchmark suite from a host of sources and we feel like what we're showing here is an honest assessment of the value of TimescaleDB.  We are pretty fast in many scenarios but our database is not meant to be a catch-all solution.  We are concerned with the marriage of speed with: convenience (being able to run a majority of queries even if not optimized), and reliability/accuracy.

We have built optimzations for both [writes to][] and [reads from][] the database.  Feel free to take a look at what we have found.  If you feel that there are query types that we haven't covered, please drop us a line at <hello@timescaledb.com>.
