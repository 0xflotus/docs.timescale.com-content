# Getting started

Something something Timescale has all the awesomeness of PostgreSQL with enhancements to handle time-series data, both in terms of faster reads and writes, and special functions to make querying your data more convenient and powerful.

[Installation][] is pretty quick and easy, whether you want to use TimescaleDB from source or run in a Docker container.

If you use PostgreSQL already, out of the gate you know a lot about what TimescaleDB can do, but the [API reference][] will show you how to create the all-important _hypertables_ and how to use our custom functions for that extra oomph to improve your productivity and exploratory power.

If you want to play around with some sample data, we have several [datasets][sample_datasets] to try out.

[Installation]: /introduction
[API reference]: /api-docs
[sample_datasets]: /getting-started/other-sample-datasets
