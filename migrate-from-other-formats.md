# Migrate Data from Other Data Sources

Something something to migrate data from your current database to TimescaleDB
requires conversion of your data to `.csv` or some similar file format.  Here
are the steps to do it.

If you are migrating from another database, your data is likely in one of two
formats we like to call _narrow row_ and _wide row_.

_Wide row_ format is similar to the way that TimescaleDB stores data, where
each row is assigned to a specific timestamp and each column is assigned to a
specific metric (i.e. temperature, device_id, event_name).  For these cases, ***

_Narrow row_ format is typical for some column-store databases, where each row
is for a particular metric/device and each column is assigned to a particular
timestamp.  For this type of data, some minor conversion to a form more suitable
to TimescaleDB is required.  ***
