# *** Basic operations

There are a couple of basic operations that you will be using frequently with
TimescaleDB, *inserting data*, *querying data*, and possibly *indexing data*.

### Inserting and querying
Inserting data into the hypertable is done via normal SQL `INSERT` commands,
e.g. using millisecond timestamps:
```sql
INSERT INTO conditions(time, location, temperature, humidity)
VALUES(NOW(), 'office', 70.0, 50.0);
```

Similarly, querying data is done via normal SQL `SELECT` commands.
SQL `UPDATE` and `DELETE` commands also work as expected.

### Indexing data

Data is indexed via the SQL `CREATE INDEX` command. For instance,
```sql
CREATE INDEX ON conditions (location, time DESC);
```
This can be done before or after converting the table to a hypertable.

**Indexing suggestions:**

Our experience has shown that for time-series data, the most-useful index type
varies depending on your data.

For indexing columns with discrete (limited-cardinality) values (e.g., where you
are most likely to use an "equals" or "not equals" comparator) we suggest using
an index like this (using our hypertable `conditions` for the example):
```sql
CREATE INDEX ON conditions (location, time DESC);
```
For all other types of columns, i.e., columns with continuous values (e.g.,
where you are most likely to use a
"less than" or "greater than" comparator) the index should be in the form:
```sql
CREATE INDEX ON conditions (time DESC, temperature);
```
Having a `time DESC` column specification in the index allows for efficient
queries by column-value and time. For example, the index defined above would
optimize the following query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM conditions WHERE location = 'garage' ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 10
```

For sparse data where a column is often NULL, we suggest adding a
`WHERE column IS NOT NULL` clause to the index (unless you are often
searching for missing data). For example,

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON conditions (time DESC, humidity) WHERE humidity IS NOT NULL;
```
this creates a more compact, and thus efficient, index.
