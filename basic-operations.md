# Basic operations

Ok, you have [installed][] TimescaleDB, and now you are ready to work with some data.  There are a couple of basic operations that you will be using frequently with TimescaleDB, *creating hypertables*, *inserting data*, *querying data*, and possibly *indexing data*.

## Working with time-series data

One of the core ideas of our time-series database are time-series optimized data tables, called **hypertables**.

### Creating a (hyper)table
To create a hypertable, you start with a regular SQL table, and then convert
it into a hypertable via the function
`create_hypertable()`([API reference][]).

The following example creates a hypertable for tracking
temperature and humidity across a collection of devices over time.

```sql
-- We start by creating a regular SQL table
CREATE TABLE conditions (
  time        TIMESTAMPTZ       NOT NULL,
  location    TEXT              NOT NULL,
  temperature DOUBLE PRECISION  NULL,
  humidity    DOUBLE PRECISION  NULL
);
```

Next, transform it into a hypertable with `create_hypertable()`:

```sql
-- This creates a hypertable that is partitioned by time
--   using the values in the `time` column.
SELECT create_hypertable('conditions', 'time');

-- OR you can additionally partition the data on another dimension
--   (what we call 'space') such as `location`.
-- For example, to partition `location` into 2 partitions:
SELECT create_hypertable('conditions', 'time', 'location', 2);
```

### Inserting and querying
Inserting data into the hypertable is done via normal SQL `INSERT` commands,
e.g. using millisecond timestamps:
```sql
INSERT INTO conditions(time, location, temperature, humidity)
VALUES(NOW(), 'office', 70.0, 50.0);
```

Similarly, querying data is done via normal SQL `SELECT` commands.
SQL `UPDATE` and `DELETE` commands also work as expected.

### Indexing data

Data is indexed using normal SQL `CREATE INDEX` commands. For instance,
```sql
CREATE INDEX ON conditions (location, time DESC);
```
This can be done before or after converting the table to a hypertable.

**Indexing suggestions:**

Our experience has shown that different types of indexes are most-useful for
time-series data, depending on your data.

For indexing columns with discrete (limited-cardinality) values (e.g., where you are most likely
  to use an "equals" or "not equals" comparator) we suggest using an index like this (using our hypertable `conditions` for the example):
```sql
CREATE INDEX ON conditions (location, time DESC);
```
For all other types of columns, i.e., columns with continuous values (e.g., where you are most likely to use a
"less than" or "greater than" comparator) the index should be in the form:
```sql
CREATE INDEX ON conditions (time DESC, temperature);
```
Having a `time DESC` column specification in the index allows for efficient queries by column-value and time. For example, the index defined above would optimize the following query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM conditions WHERE location = 'garage' ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 10
```

For sparse data where a column is often NULL, we suggest adding a
`WHERE column IS NOT NULL` clause to the index (unless you are often
searching for missing data). For example,

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON conditions (time DESC, humidity) WHERE humidity IS NOT NULL;
```
this creates a more compact, and thus efficient, index.
