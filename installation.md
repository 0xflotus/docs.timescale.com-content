# Installation

TimescaleDB is packaged as a PostgreSQL extension and set of scripts.

There are several ways to install TimescaleDB: (1) Homebrew (for MacOS),
(2) Docker, or (3) from source.

## Installation (from source)

_NOTE: Currently, upgrading to new versions of TimescaleDB requires a fresh install._

**Prerequisite**

- The [Postgres client][Postgres-client] (psql) is required for all of the following installation methods.

### Option 1 - Homebrew

This will install PostgreSQL 9.6 via Homebrew as well. If you have
another installation (such as Postgres.app), this will cause problems. We
recommend removing other installations before using this method.

**Prerequisites**

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

**Build and install**

```bash
# Add our tap
brew tap timescale/tap

# To install
brew install timescaledb
```

**Update `postgresql.conf`**

Also, you will need to edit your `postgresql.conf` file to include
necessary libraries:
```bash
# Modify postgresql.conf to uncomment this line and add required libraries.
# For example:
shared_preload_libraries = 'dblink,timescaledb'
```

To get started you'll now need to restart PostgreSQL and add a
`postgres` superuser (used in the rest of the docs):
```bash
# Restart PostgreSQL
brew services restart postgresql

# Add a superuser postgres:
createuser postgres -s
```

### Option 2 - Docker Hub

You can pull our Docker images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/timescaledb/timescaledb/).

```bash
docker pull timescaledb/timescaledb:latest
```

### Option 3 - From source
We have only tested our build process on **MacOS and Linux**. We do
not support building on Windows yet. Windows may be able to use our
Docker image on Docker Hub (see above).

**Prerequisites**

- A standard **PostgreSQL 9.6** installation with development environment (header files) (e.g., [Postgres.app for MacOS][Postgres-app])

**Build and install with local PostgreSQL**

Clone the repository from our [Github site][Github] and navigate to the repo base directory.

```bash
# To build the extension
make

# To install
make install
```

**Update `postgresql.conf`**

Also, you will need to edit your `postgresql.conf` file to include
necessary libraries, and then restart PostgreSQL:
```bash
# Modify postgresql.conf to add required libraries. For example,
shared_preload_libraries = 'dblink,timescaledb'

# Then, restart PostgreSQL
```
*Note:* The `shared_preload_libraries` line is commented out by default.  Make sure to uncomment it.

## Setting up your initial database
You have two options for setting up your initial database:
1. *Empty Database* - To set up a new, empty database, please follow the instructions below.

2. *Database with pre-loaded sample data* - To help you quickly get started, we have also created some sample datasets.
See [Sample Datasets][datasets] for further instructions. (Includes installing our extension.)

[datasets]: /other-sample-datasets

### Setting up an empty database

When creating a new database, it is necessary to install the extension and then run an initialization function.  Here we will create a new database named "tutorial".

```bash
# Connect to Postgres as a superuser named 'postgres'
psql -U postgres -h localhost
```

```sql
-- Install the extension
CREATE database tutorial;

\c tutorial

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb CASCADE;

-- Run initialization function
select setup_timescaledb();
```

For convenience, this can also be done in one step by running a script from
the command-line:
```bash
DB_NAME=tutorial ./scripts/setup-db.sh
```

You should now have a brand new time-series database running in Postgres.

```bash
# To access your new database
psql -U postgres -h localhost -d tutorial
```

Next let's load some data.

## Working with time-series data

One of the core ideas of our time-series database are time-series optimized data tables, called **hypertables**.

### Creating a (hyper)table
To create a hypertable, you start with a regular SQL table, and then convert
it into a hypertable via the function
`create_hypertable()`([API definition](/api-docs)).

The following example creates a hypertable for tracking
temperature and humidity across a collection of devices over time.

```sql
-- We start by creating a regular SQL table
CREATE TABLE conditions (
  time        TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  device_id   TEXT                     NOT NULL,
  temperature DOUBLE PRECISION         NULL,
  humidity    DOUBLE PRECISION         NULL
);
```

Next, transform it into a hypertable using the provided function
`create_hypertable()`:

```sql
-- This creates a hypertable that is partitioned by time
--   using the values in the `time` column.
SELECT create_hypertable('conditions', 'time');

-- OR you can additionally partition the data on another dimension
--   (what we call 'space') such as `device_id`.
-- For example, to partition `device_id` into 2 partitions:
SELECT create_hypertable('conditions', 'time', 'device_id', 2);
```

### Inserting and querying
Inserting data into the hypertable is done via normal SQL `INSERT` commands,
e.g. using millisecond timestamps:
```sql
INSERT INTO conditions(time,device_id,temperature,humidity)
VALUES(NOW(), 'office', 70.0, 50.0);
```

Similarly, querying data is done via normal SQL `SELECT` commands.
SQL `UPDATE` and `DELETE` commands also work as expected.

### Indexing data

Data is indexed using normal SQL `CREATE INDEX` commands. For instance,
```sql
CREATE INDEX ON conditions (device_id, time DESC);
```
This can be done before or after converting the table to a hypertable.

**Indexing suggestions:**

Our experience has shown that different types of indexes are most-useful for
time-series data, depending on your data.

For indexing columns with discrete (limited-cardinality) values
(e.g., where you are most likely to use an "equals" or "not equals" comparator)
we suggest using an index like this (using our hypertable `conditions` for the example):
```sql
CREATE INDEX ON conditions (device_id, time DESC);
```
For all other types of columns, i.e., columns with continuous values (e.g., where you are most likely to use a
"less than" or "greater than" comparator) the index should be in the form:
```sql
CREATE INDEX ON conditions (time DESC, temperature);
```
Having a `time DESC` column specification in the index allows for efficient
queries by column-value and time. For example, the index defined above would
optimize the following query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM conditions WHERE device_id = 'dev_1' ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 10
```

For sparse data where a column is often NULL, we suggest adding a
`WHERE column IS NOT NULL` clause to the index (unless you are often
searching for missing data). For example,

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON conditions (time DESC, humidity) WHERE humidity IS NOT NULL;
```
this creates a more compact, and thus efficient, index.
